A rook is a piece in the strategy board game of chess. 
Formerly the piece was called the tower, marquess, rector, and comes (Sunnucks 1970). 
The term castle is considered informal, incorrect, or old-fashioned.[1][2] However, 
in Persian the word for "castling" is qal'eh raften (from qal'eh, "castle") and not rokh raftan.
Each player starts the game with two rooks, one in each of the corner squares on their own side of the board.
