The queen is the strongest piece in the game of chess, 
able to move any number of squares vertically, 
horizontally or diagonally. Each player starts the game with one queen, 
placed in the middle of the first rank next to the king. 
Because of the value of a queen, 
it is sometimes used as bait to lure an opponent into a trap by a queen sacrifice. 
Another tactic is to use the queen to threaten the opponent's queen, 
to either retreat or to exchange the queen (losing both of them) to reduce the game to less strong pieces. 
The queen is often used in conjunction with another piece, such as teamed with a bishop or rook, 
where the pieces could guard each other while threatening the opponent pieces.
